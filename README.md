# SpaceX_Falcon9_FirstStage_Recovery_Prediction
## Context
I did this project as capstone project under IBM Data science series offered by coursera, SpaceX provides rocket launching facility at much lower prices than their market competition 
Much of this is because of reusability of first stage of Falcon 9 Rocket. This project aims to explore data driven  approches to predict the success of first stage landing (or reusabiility)
This predictive model can be useful for decision making purposes. The methodology involved data collection using API, Cleaning and EDA , Visualisation using Folium and plotly Dash. 
And at last building various supervised algorithms for prediction.
## File Structure
